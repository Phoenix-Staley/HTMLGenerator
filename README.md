  ## Description

  This program uses node.js and the inquirer node module to take inputs from a user about employee information and the style of webpage the user wants. It then takes this information and generates an HTML file that displays this information in an easy to view format. This project was created as a homework assignment for the web development / JavaScript bootcamp by the University of Washington.
